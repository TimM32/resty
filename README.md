# Lab 26 - Component Based UI

Project bootstrap with Create React App

## Author: Tim Maupin

## Project Domain

- SASS - Nesting and Variables
- "Component Architecture"
- Application and Component "State"
- Debate/Discuss Libraries vs Frameworks
- Basics of a React App
    - index.html in public (root div)
    - index.js as an untouchable "bootstrap" or "entry point"
    - React Renders into that div
    - JSX is actually javascript but it looks like markup
    - Components can be classes or functions. What gets "returned" gets "rendered"
        - Class - render() { return(jsx) }
        - Function - return(jsx)
    - Components can load and render each other
    - Components can load their own css
